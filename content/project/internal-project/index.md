The goal of this project was to building a recommender app system in the platform and topic of my choice. As I thought more of what topic I was going to do the constant going back and forth reminded me of how I go back and forth when I try to decide a movie, tv show, and music to play. Not only I have this problem but many people do, so not only deciding my topic will be movies would help myself but other users as well. 

Movies have been a part of life since I could remember, I really enjoyed going to the movie theater to watch and watching a video cassette, DVD, and streaming any movie. At one point I wanted direct my own movie, be a director because I really like how the ideas they had along with writers and actors came to life. My selections of movies that I watched or want to watch I believed I knew it all but as more movies are produced and some that have been made in the past I tend to forget those. Those movies that could possibly end up being a favorite and special one. 

The system will be on a web-based platform.
