**Sketches** makes it easy to plan and develop any application. I have designed UI Layouts for a project I am currently working on, each feature that will be shown will have a "Usage Scenario" which shows how each featured will be used by the user. More information about the project can be found under the "Projects" tab on my homepage.

- Key features that will be previewed:

  - Search
  - Classifier
  - Recommender
  - My Watch List
